# Checkmarx Plugin Updater

This documentation is currently sparse.  More detailed documentation will be forthcoming.

The ideal development IDE for this project is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).  Java, Git, and Docker plugins will allow you to automatically run unit tests and run the code in a debugger.

Executing `gradlew build` in the root of this project should properly build all components.

To see the logic in action, you need at least a test web server (one that runs locally is provided [here](test_webserver)) and to execute the [Command Line Tester](cmdline_tester).
